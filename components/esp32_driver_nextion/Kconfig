            Time, in milliseconds, to wait for a mutex to be acquired.
            Mutex is used to lock the UART and allow only one command or
            event processing to be sent.

            The UART buffer used for receiving messages.

            Use a big size if you intend to receive a lot of event messages
            in a short time span and/or the event message processing is slow.

            The UART buffer used to format command before sending.
            It is used for 'vprintf' command.

            Use a big size if you intend to send big text messages.
